## Description

Easy-ui5 is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator which enables you to create simple [OpenUI5](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/)-based web-apps within seconds.

This generator has been created to simplify the creation of your OpenUI5 prototypes. Now you can scaffold simple UI5 projects from the shell/terminal of your choice. The current best practices (such as [async](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/12/18/ui5ers-buzz-41-best-practices-for-async-loading-in-ui5/)) are already baked into our templates so you don't have to worry about the definition of the metadata files.

The purpose of this generator is to guide you on your first steps with SAPUI5 and SAP Cloud Platform deployments. Once you are familiar with those technologies, you might want to tweak the projects to adapt them for productive use-cases (such as continuous deployment pipelines and full i18n).


## Installation

1. Get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 8.5 or higher)
2. Install the generator
    ```sh
    npm install -g yo generator-easy-ui5
    ```
3. Verify your installation to see if Yeoman has been installed correctly
    ```sh
    yo
    ```
	Make sure you see the `easy-ui5` generator listed.


## Usage
