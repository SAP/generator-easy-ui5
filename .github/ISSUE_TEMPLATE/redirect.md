I'm sorry to hear that easy-ui5 generated broken files. Please report this issue directly in the repository for the plugin that you used. You can find all plugins in the [UI5 Community organization](https://github.com/ui5-community/). 

Here are a few direct links to some plugins:
* [UI5 Project](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project)
* [UI5 Library](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-library)
* [UI5 Control](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-control)
